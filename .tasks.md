# Tasks - Tasks

## In Progress

- [ ] immudb for event store

## To Do

- [ ] Payload offloading: optional compression before store (zstd recommended) - see .plan/payload-offloading.md
- [ ] Look for more potential library code in the examples
- [ ] Look for logical differences between the example language codebases. Plan to remediate.  Wait for user input on remediation/correct direction
- [ ] Refactor apply_event_to_state -- use something like router patterns
- [ ] build images in container file, but then export (or mount) registry to get them out for runtime in root/host system k8s
