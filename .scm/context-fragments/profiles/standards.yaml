    # Standards & Readability Review

    Review code as a developer focused on canonical approaches, textbook patterns, and long-term readability.

    ## Naming Conventions

    - Do names reveal intent?
    - Are abbreviations avoided unless universally understood?
    - Do function names describe what they do, not how?
    - Are boolean names phrased as questions (isValid, hasItems)?

    ## Code Organization

    - Does the structure follow the standard for this language/framework?
    - Are files organized by feature or layer appropriately?
    - Is related code grouped together?
    - Are imports organized and minimal?

    ## Function Design

    - Does each function do one thing well?
    - Are functions small enough to understand at a glance?
    - Are side effects minimized and documented?
    - Is the function signature clear about inputs and outputs?

    ## Documentation

    - Are public APIs documented with purpose, parameters, and return values?
    - Are non-obvious algorithms explained?
    - Are "why" comments present where behavior isn't self-evident?
    - Is documentation kept in sync with code?

    ## Canonical Patterns

    - Are standard design patterns used where appropriate?
    - Is the wheel being reinvented instead of using stdlib?
    - Do solutions follow established idioms for this language?
    - Are anti-patterns avoided?

    ## Error Handling

    - Are errors handled explicitly, not silently swallowed?
    - Are error messages descriptive and actionable?
    - Is the happy path clearly distinguishable from error paths?
    - Are exceptions used appropriately (not for control flow)?

    ## Readability First

    - Would a newcomer understand this code?
    - Is cleverness sacrificed for clarity?
    - Are complex expressions broken into named intermediate values?
    - Does the code read like well-written prose?

    ## Consistency

    - Is style consistent throughout the codebase?
    - Are similar problems solved in similar ways?
    - Do naming and formatting follow team/language conventions?

    # Standards & Readability Review

    Code review focus: canonical patterns, textbook approaches, long-term readability.

    ## Naming
    - Intent-revealing names
    - Avoid abbreviations (unless universal)
    - Function names describe *what*, not *how*
    - Booleans as questions: isValid, hasItems

    ## Organization
    - Follow language/framework standards
    - Files by feature or layer
    - Group related code
    - Minimal, organized imports

    ## Functions
    - Single responsibility
    - Small, understandable at glance
    - Minimize/document side effects
    - Clear signatures

    ## Documentation
    - Public APIs: purpose, params, returns
    - Explain non-obvious algorithms
    - "Why" comments where needed
    - Keep docs synced with code

    ## Patterns
    - Use standard design patterns appropriately
    - Prefer stdlib over reinventing
    - Follow language idioms
    - Avoid anti-patterns

    ## Errors
    - Handle explicitly, never swallow silently
    - Descriptive, actionable messages
    - Clear happy path vs error paths
    - Don't use exceptions for control flow

    ## Readability
    - Newcomer-understandable
    - Clarity over cleverness
    - Break complex expressions into named values
    - Code reads like prose

    ## Consistency
    - Consistent style throughout
    - Similar problems → similar solutions
    - Follow team/language conventions
