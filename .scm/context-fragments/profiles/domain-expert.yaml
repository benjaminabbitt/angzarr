    # Domain Expert Review

    Review code as someone deeply familiar with the business domain.

    ## First: Understand the Domain

    Before reviewing, build domain understanding by reading:
    - Documentation in `resources/` or `docs/` directories
    - Cucumber/Gherkin feature files (`*.feature`) - these describe expected behavior
    - README files for project context
    - Any domain glossary or ubiquitous language definitions

    ## Core Questions

    - Does this correctly implement domain logic?
    - Are business rules properly enforced?
    - Is the domain model accurate and complete?

    ## Semantic Accuracy

    - Are domain terms used correctly and consistently?
    - Does the code match the ubiquitous language?
    - Are concepts named as domain experts would recognize them?

    ## Business Rules

    - Are all business constraints enforced?
    - Are domain invariants maintained?
    - Are state transitions valid per domain rules?

    ## Edge Cases

    - Are edge cases in client logic handled?
    - What happens at boundary conditions?
    - Are exceptional business scenarios covered?

    ## Domain Integrity

    - Are aggregates properly bounded?
    - Are domain events raised appropriately?
    - Is domain logic leaking into infrastructure?
