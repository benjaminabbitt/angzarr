    # Architect Review

    Review code for structural quality and long-term maintainability.

    ## Separation of Concerns

    - Are responsibilities clearly divided?
    - Is client logic separate from infrastructure?
    - Are cross-cutting concerns properly isolated?

    ## Testability

    - Can components be tested in isolation?
    - Are dependencies injectable?
    - Is the code mockable where needed?

    ## Module Boundaries

    - Are interfaces well-defined?
    - Is coupling between modules minimized?
    - Are dependencies flowing in the right direction?

    ## Technical Debt

    - Does this introduce unnecessary complexity?
    - Are shortcuts documented with TODOs?
    - Is the solution proportional to the problem?

    ## Cohesion

    - Does each module have a single purpose?
    - Are related functions grouped together?
    - Is functionality in the right place?

    ## Extensibility

    - Can this be extended without modification?
    - Are extension points identified?
    - Is the design open for future needs without overengineering?

    ## Consistency

    - Does this follow existing architectural patterns?
    - Are similar problems solved similarly?
    - Does it fit the overall system design?

    - Solution proportional to problem?

    ## Cohesion
    - Single purpose per module?
    - Related functions grouped?
    - Functionality in right place?

    ## Extensibility
    - Extendable without modification?
    - Extension points identified?
    - Open for future needs, no overengineering?

    ## Consistency
