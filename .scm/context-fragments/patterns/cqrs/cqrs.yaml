    # CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

    Separate read and write operations into distinct models.

    ## Core Principles

    - **Commands**: Modify state, return void or ID only, named imperatively (`CreateOrder`, `UpdateUser`)
    - **Queries**: Read state, never modify, named descriptively (`GetOrderById`, `ListActiveUsers`)
    - **Separation**: Command and query models can differ in structure and storage

    ## Command Side

    - Commands are imperative: `PlaceOrder`, `CancelSubscription`
    - Command handlers validate, execute client logic, persist state
    - One command = one transaction
    - Return only success/failure or created entity ID

    ## Query Side

    - Queries are questions: `GetUserProfile`, `SearchProducts`
    - Query handlers read from optimized read models
    - No side effects — safe to retry, cache, parallelize
    - Can use denormalized views for performance

    ## When to Use CQRS

    - Read and write patterns differ significantly
    - Need independent scaling of reads vs writes
    - Complex domain with rich client logic
    - Event sourcing integration

    ## When NOT to Use CQRS

    - Simple CRUD applications
    - Read/write patterns are similar
    - Small team or early-stage project
    - Adds unnecessary complexity

    ## Read Model Synchronization

    - **Synchronous**: Update read model in same transaction (simpler, consistent)
    - **Asynchronous**: Update via events (scalable, eventually consistent)
    - Document consistency guarantees for your system

    ## Testing

    - Test commands: verify state changes and invariants
    - Test queries: verify correct data retrieval
    - Test separately — they are independent concerns

    # CQRS

    Separate read/write ops into distinct models.

    ## Core Principles
    - **Commands**: Modify state, return void/ID only, imperative names (`CreateOrder`)
    - **Queries**: Read state, never modify, descriptive names (`GetOrderById`)
    - **Separation**: Models can differ in structure/storage

    ## Command Side
    - Imperative: `PlaceOrder`, `CancelSubscription`

    ## Query Side
    - Questions: `GetUserProfile`, `SearchProducts`

    ## When to Use
    - Read/write patterns differ significantly
    - Need independent scaling
    - Complex domain with rich client logic
    - Event sourcing integration

    ## When NOT to Use
    - Simple CRUD
    - Similar read/write patterns
    - Small team/early-stage
    - Adds unnecessary complexity

    ## Read Model Sync
    - **Synchronous**: Same transaction (simpler, consistent)
    - **Asynchronous**: Via events (scalable, eventually consistent)
    - Document consistency guarantees

    ## Testing
    - Commands: verify state changes/invariants
    - Queries: verify correct retrieval
    - Test separately—independent concerns
