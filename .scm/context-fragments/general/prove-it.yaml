    # Prove It: Behavioural Diff Demonstration

    Demonstrate that changes work by showing the concrete difference in behaviour between the main branch and the current branch.

    ## Process

    1. **Identify the behavioural claims** - What is this branch supposed to change? What should be different?
    2. **Design demonstrations** - Create concrete scenarios that exercise the changed behaviour
    3. **Show the before** - Run the demonstration against the main branch (or describe its behaviour based on the code)
    4. **Show the after** - Run the same demonstration against the current branch
    5. **Present the diff** - Side-by-side comparison of inputs, outputs, and observable effects

    ## Demonstration Methods

    - **Test output**: Run tests on both branches, compare results
    - **CLI invocation**: Execute the same command on both branches, show output differences
    - **Code walkthrough**: Trace the same input through both code paths, show where behaviour diverges
    - **API calls**: Same request, different responses
    - **Error scenarios**: Show how failure modes differ between branches

    ## Presentation Format

    For each behavioural change:

    ```
    ## [Description of behaviour]

    ### Main branch
    Input: ...
    Output/Behaviour: ...

    ### This branch
    Input: ...
    Output/Behaviour: ...

    ### What changed
    [Concise explanation of the difference and why it matters]
    ```

    ## Rules

    - Cover all intended behavioural changes, not just the happy path
    - Include edge cases and error conditions
    - If a change is purely structural (refactoring), demonstrate that behaviour is preserved
    - Do not claim changes work without evidence - show, don't tell
    - If demonstration requires infrastructure not available locally, describe what would be tested and how

    # Prove It: Behavioural Diff Demonstration

    Show concrete behaviour difference between main branch and current branch.

    ## Process
    1. Identify behavioural claims - what should differ?
    2. Design demonstrations exercising changed behaviour
    3. Show before (main branch behaviour)
    4. Show after (current branch behaviour)
    5. Present side-by-side diff of inputs, outputs, effects

    ## Demonstration Methods
    - Test output comparison across branches
    - CLI invocation: same command, different output
    - Code walkthrough: trace input through both paths, show divergence
    - API calls: same request, different responses
    - Error scenarios: differing failure modes

    ## Format

    Per behavioural change:
    ```
    ## [Behaviour description]
    ### Main branch
    Input: ... Output/Behaviour: ...
    ### This branch
    Input: ... Output/Behaviour: ...
    ### What changed
    [Concise diff explanation + why it matters]
    ```

    ## Rules
    - Cover all intended changes, not just happy path
    - Include edge cases and error conditions
    - For pure refactors, demonstrate preserved behaviour
    - Show evidence, don't just claim
    - If local demo impossible, describe what would be tested and how
