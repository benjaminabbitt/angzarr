    Write or update a README.md for this project targeting developers as the primary audience.

    ## Structure (in this order)

    1. **Project Name & One-liner** - What it is in one sentence
    2. **The Problem** - What pain points does this solve? Why should developers care?
    3. **The Solution** - How does this tool address those problems?
    4. **Quick Start** - Minimal steps to get running (install, configure, first command)
    5. **Usage Examples** - Common use cases with concrete commands
    6. **Configuration** - Key settings and customization options
    7. **Development** - How to build, test, and contribute (for contributors)

    ## Do Not
    - Put in a structure with file system/directory lists.  The user can read that on their own computer.
    - Be verbose/add low-utility verbiage.

    ## When Updating an Existing README

    - Preserve all existing content unless it conflicts with current functionality
    - Remove or update sections describing changed or removed features
    - Maintain the author's voice and style where possible
    - Add new sections for new functionality
    - Reorganize to match the structure above if needed

    ## Use Version Control History

    - Review git log and diffs to identify recent changes to the codebase
    - Look for new features, renamed commands, changed behavior
    - Pay special attention to small README diffs - these are often human edits with important context or corrections
    - Large README rewrites may be generated; small tweaks are likely intentional refinements
    - Check commit messages for context on why changes were made

    ## Guidelines

    - Lead with value: problems solved and benefits before technical details
    - Be concise: developers skim READMEs, use bullets and code blocks
    - Show, don't tell: prefer examples over descriptions
    - Keep development/build instructions at the end - most users don't need them
    - Include a "Why this tool?" section if similar tools exist
    - Avoid marketing language; be direct and technical

    2. **Problem** - Pain points solved
    3. **Solution** - How it addresses them
    4. **Quick Start** - Install, configure, first command
    5. **Usage Examples** - Common commands
    6. **Configuration** - Key settings
    7. **Development** - Build, test, contribute (at end)

    ## Don't
    - Include filesystem/directory listings
    - Be verbose

    ## Updating Existing README
    - Preserve content unless outdated
    - Update/remove changed features
    - Keep author's voice
    - Add new sections as needed
    - Reorganize to match structure

    ## Use Git History
    - Check git log/diffs for recent changes
    - Small README diffs = intentional human edits (important)

    - Review commit messages for context

    ## Guidelines
    - Lead w/ value (problems/benefits first)
    - Be concise (bullets, code blocks)
    - Show don't tell (examples > descriptions)
    - Dev instructions at end
    - Add "Why this tool?" if alternatives exist
    - No marketing speak; be direct
