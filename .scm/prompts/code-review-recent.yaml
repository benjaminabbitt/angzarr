    # Code Review - Recent Changes

    Review all changes since the last commit.

    ## Step 1: Examine Changes

    Run `git diff HEAD~1` to see what changed (or `git diff --staged` for uncommitted changes).

    ## Step 2: Apply Review Perspectives

    - **Architecture** - Structure, boundaries, testability, technical debt
    - **Performance** - Algorithms, data structures, complexity, efficiency
    - **Standards** - Readability, naming, documentation, canonical patterns
    - **Concurrency** - Thread safety, race conditions, synchronization (if applicable)
    - **Domain** - Business logic correctness, domain model accuracy (if applicable)

    ## Step 3: Report Findings

    ### Summary
    What do these changes accomplish?

    ### Critical Issues
    Must fix before merging.

    ### Medium Issues
    Should address but doesn't block.
