//! Process Manager event handler.
//!
//! Receives events from the event bus and orchestrates process manager execution
//! using the shared orchestration module.
//!
//! Works with any `PMContextFactory` implementation — gRPC (distributed)
//! or local (in-process) — enabling deploy-anywhere process manager code.
