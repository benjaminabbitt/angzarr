/// - Min delay: 10ms

/// - Max attempts: 10
/// - Jitter enabled
///
/// # Why These Values?
///
/// - **10ms min**: Sequence conflicts typically resolve quickly — another writer
///   just beat us. A brief delay is enough to let their write complete.
/// - **2s max**: If conflicts persist beyond 2s, something unusual is happening
///   (high contention, slow storage). Cap the delay to avoid blocking too long.
/// - **10 attempts**: Enough to ride out typical contention spikes. Beyond 10,
///   the conflict is likely structural (two components fighting over the same
///   aggregate), not transient.
/// - **Jitter**: Prevents thundering herd when multiple retries happen simultaneously.

/// # Why These Values?
///
/// - **100ms min**: Network connections need more time than sequence retries.
///   Services might still be starting, DNS might be propagating.
/// - **5s max**: Connection issues can be transient (pod rescheduling, DNS
///   propagation). 5s is long enough for most K8s operations without making
///   startup feel stuck.
/// - **30 attempts**: At exponential backoff from 100ms to 5s, this gives
///   roughly 2-3 minutes of total retry time — enough for pod startup and
///   K8s service discovery to stabilize.

/// Determines if a gRPC error is retryable.
///
/// Aligned with R2-15 decision #2 so the same classifier governs retry
/// behavior across aggregate, saga, PM, and projector handler paths.
/// Stays consistent with `crate::dlq::trigger::CodeDlqExt::classify_for_dlq`:
/// codes that classifier sends to `DlqTrigger::RetryThenDlq` are the
/// retryable ones here, with the sequence-conflict exception below.
///
/// # Retryable Codes
///
/// - **`Unavailable`**, **`DeadlineExceeded`**, **`ResourceExhausted`**:
///   Downstream temporarily overloaded or unreachable. A retry after
///   backoff often succeeds.
/// - **`Internal`**, **`Unknown`**, **`DataLoss`**: Server-side faults
///   that may be transient (leader re-election, transient storage hiccup,
///   process restart). Retry, then DLQ on exhaustion.
/// - **`Cancelled`**: Upstream / shutdown cancellation that typically
///   recovers on the next event-loop tick.
/// - **Sequence-conflict `FailedPrecondition`**: messages starting
///   `"Sequence mismatch:"` (from `single_sequence_check`) or
///   `"Sequence conflict:"` (from `storage::error::SEQUENCE_CONFLICT`).
///   Two writers raced; the loser refetches fresh state and retries.
///   Event sourcing's per-sequence idempotency makes this safe.
///
/// # Non-Retryable Codes
///
/// All other 4xx-class codes (`InvalidArgument`, `NotFound`, `Aborted`,
/// `Unimplemented`, `PermissionDenied`, `Unauthenticated`, `OutOfRange`,
/// `AlreadyExists`) plus non-sequence-conflict `FailedPrecondition`
/// (business guards like "Hand already dealt", "Player does not exist" —
/// refreshing state just re-hits the guard). `Aborted` specifically
/// covers MERGE_MANUAL routing, where the aggregate owner asked for
/// human review rather than automated retry. These all map to
/// `DlqTrigger::Immediate` at the DLQ layer.
///
/// # Why This Set?
///
/// Before R2-15, only sequence-conflict `FailedPrecondition` was
/// retryable — the narrow definition made sense for the aggregate
/// pipeline (sequence races are the dominant transient case there) but
/// silently dropped legitimate transient errors (broker briefly down,
/// downstream rebalancing) into the no-retry / DLQ-immediate bucket on
/// the saga/PM/projector paths. R2-15 broadens the helper to the gRPC
/// canonical transient set so all four handler types share one
/// operator contract: 4xx → DLQ now, 5xx → retry then DLQ.
///
/// # Consequence on Aggregate Retry Behavior
///
/// The aggregate command pipeline (`orchestration/aggregate/pipeline.rs`)
/// will now retry on the full 5xx-class set, not just sequence
/// conflicts. Aggregates will hold commands longer in the face of
/// downstream blips rather than rejecting fast; operators who relied
/// on fast-reject behavior for non-sequence transient codes will see
/// delayed rejections. Accepted per R2-15.
