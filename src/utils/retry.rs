/// - Min delay: 10ms

/// - Max attempts: 10
/// - Jitter enabled
///
/// # Why These Values?
///
/// - **10ms min**: Sequence conflicts typically resolve quickly — another writer
///   just beat us. A brief delay is enough to let their write complete.
/// - **2s max**: If conflicts persist beyond 2s, something unusual is happening
///   (high contention, slow storage). Cap the delay to avoid blocking too long.
/// - **10 attempts**: Enough to ride out typical contention spikes. Beyond 10,
///   the conflict is likely structural (two components fighting over the same
///   aggregate), not transient.
/// - **Jitter**: Prevents thundering herd when multiple retries happen simultaneously.

/// - Jitter enabled
///
/// # Why These Values?
///
/// - **100ms min**: Network connections need more time than sequence retries.
///   Services might still be starting, DNS might be propagating.
/// - **5s max**: Connection issues can be transient (pod rescheduling, DNS
///   propagation). 5s is long enough for most K8s operations without making
///   startup feel stuck.
/// - **30 attempts**: At exponential backoff from 100ms to 5s, this gives
///   roughly 2-3 minutes of total retry time — enough for pod startup and
///   K8s service discovery to stabilize.

/// Determines if a gRPC error is retryable.
///
/// # Retryable Codes
///
/// - **`FailedPrecondition`**: Sequence mismatch with STRICT or COMMUTATIVE merge
///   strategy. The client's command had a stale sequence number. Fix: fetch fresh
///   state, rebuild command with correct sequence, retry.
///
/// # Non-Retryable Codes
///
/// - **`Aborted`**: Used for MERGE_MANUAL when sequence mismatch occurs. The
///   framework routes these to DLQ for human review — automated retry won't help.
/// - **Other codes**: Business rejections, validation errors, network errors, etc.
///   These require human intervention or code fixes.
///
/// # Why This Distinction?
///
/// Sequence conflicts are often transient — two concurrent writers raced, one won.
/// The loser should fetch fresh state and retry with the updated sequence. This is
/// safe because event sourcing guarantees idempotency via sequence numbers.
///
/// MERGE_MANUAL conflicts are different: the aggregate owner explicitly chose to
/// require human review rather than auto-retry. Respecting that decision means
/// routing to DLQ, not retrying.
