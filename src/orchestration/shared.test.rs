//! Tests for fill_correlation_id.
//!
//! Correlation IDs enable cross-domain tracing in saga and process manager
//! flows. When a saga produces commands, the framework must ensure each
//! command carries the correlation ID from the triggering event — otherwise
//! observability breaks and PMs cannot correlate related events.
