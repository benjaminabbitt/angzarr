//! Saga orchestration abstraction.
//!
//! Sagas are **pure translators**: they receive source events and produce commands
//! for target domains. They are stateless — each event is processed independently
//! with no memory of previous events. This enables horizontal scaling and simple recovery.
//!
//! # Execution Model
//!
//! Sagas receive only source events — NO destination state. The framework handles:
//!
//! 1. **Sequence stamping**: Commands have `angzarr_deferred`, framework stamps
//!    explicit sequences on delivery.
//!
//! 2. **Delivery retry**: On sequence conflict, framework retries command delivery
//!    with fresh sequence (NOT saga re-execution).
//!
//! 3. **Provenance tracking**: `angzarr_deferred` links commands to source events
//!    for compensation routing and idempotency.
//!
//! # Retry Strategy
//!
//! When commands fail due to sequence conflicts, we retry at the delivery level
//! with exponential backoff. The saga is NOT re-executed — commands are produced
//! once, and the framework handles delivery retries.
//!
//! # Module Structure
//!
//! - `local/`: in-process saga handler calls (standalone mode)
//! - `grpc/`: remote gRPC saga client calls (distributed mode)
