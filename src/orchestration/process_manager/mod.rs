//! Process manager orchestration abstraction.
//!
//! Process managers (PMs) coordinate multi-domain workflows by correlating events
//! across different aggregates. Unlike sagas, PMs are **stateful** — they maintain
//! their own event stream to track workflow progress.
//!
//! # PM vs Saga
//!
//! | Aspect | Saga | Process Manager |
//! |--------|------|-----------------|
//! | State | Stateless (per-event) | Stateful (persists progress) |
//! | Input | Single domain events | Multi-domain events (via correlation_id) |
//! | Identity | None (ephemeral) | correlation_id IS the PM root |
//! | Recovery | Replay event | Resume from persisted PM state |
//!
//! # Correlation ID as PM Root
//!
//! The correlation_id serves double duty: it identifies both the cross-domain
//! workflow AND the PM's aggregate root. This means:
//!
//! - `fetcher.fetch_by_correlation(pm_domain, correlation_id)` returns the PM's own state
//! - All PM events are stored under `(pm_domain, correlation_id)` as root
//! - Commands rejected route back via `angzarr_deferred.source.root = correlation_id`
//!
//! # Execution Flow
//!
//! 1. **Fetch PM state**: Load existing workflow progress by correlation_id
//! 2. **Handle**: PM produces commands + its own state events
//! 3. **Persist PM events**: Store PM state changes (retries on conflict)
//! 4. **Execute commands**: Send to target aggregates (no retry here)
//!
//! PM event persistence is retried but command execution is not — commands may
//! succeed/fail independently, and the PM can observe outcomes via Notifications.
//!
//! # Module Structure
//!
//! - `local/`: in-process PM handler calls
//! - `grpc/`: remote gRPC PM client calls (distributed mode)

///
/// - PM state is always re-fetched (it's the thing that might have conflicted)
/// - The retry boundary is "PM events persisted" — once that succeeds, we're done
/// - Commands are fire-and-forget with compensation (no retry needed)
///
/// A manual loop with `delays.next()` is clearer than shoehorning this into the
/// saga retry pattern.
///
/// # Ordering Invariant: PM Events Before Commands
///
/// PM events MUST persist before executing commands. This ensures:
///
/// 1. **Crash recovery**: If we crash after persisting PM events but before
///    commands, the PM state records what we intended to do. On restart, we
///    can either retry commands or detect duplicates.
///
/// 2. **Compensation routing**: If a command fails, the PM receives a Notification.
///    The PM state must already reflect that we attempted this command so the
///    compensation handler has context.
///
/// If we reversed the order (commands first), a crash between command success
/// and PM event persistence would leave the PM state inconsistent.
