//! Hybrid destination fetcher for process manager sidecars.
//!
//! # The Chicken-and-Egg Problem
//!
//! Process managers (PMs) need to fetch their own state to make decisions, but:
//! - PMs run as sidecars, not as aggregate services
//! - The normal destination fetcher routes to aggregate services via gRPC
//! - There IS no aggregate service for the PM domain — the PM sidecar IS the service
//!
//! The hybrid fetcher solves this by routing queries for the PM's own domain to
//! local storage, while delegating all other domain queries to the remote fetcher.
//!
//! # Why Not Just Use Local Storage for Everything?
//!
//! The PM sidecar only has storage for its own domain. Other domains (order,
//! inventory, player, etc.) are served by their respective aggregate sidecars.
//! Hybrid routing is the cleanest way to handle "local for self, remote for others".
//!
//! # Snapshot Optimization
//!
//! Uses `EventBookRepository` for local fetches to properly load snapshots
//! and only fetch events AFTER the snapshot sequence. Direct EventStore queries
//! would either miss snapshots or double-apply events.
