//! Unit tests for SNS/SQS FIFO MessageGroupId / MessageDeduplicationId
//! construction (C-12 regression suite).
//!
//! These tests exercise the pure helper `build_fifo_attributes` so they do
//! not need an AWS SDK client, LocalStack, or Floci — the construction
//! logic is independent of the wire-level publish call, and the bug being
//! remediated lives entirely in that construction.
//!
//! C-12 (from `plans/deep-review-remediation.md`):
//!   1. `book.root_id_hex().unwrap_or_default()` produces an empty string
//!      when the EventBook has no root. AWS FIFO rejects empty
//!      MessageGroupId outright.
//!   2. If a non-FIFO broker (or mock) accepts the empty group_id, all
//!      root-less events collapse into one serialized ordering group —
//!      silently serialising independent aggregates.
//!   3. `ContentBasedDeduplication=false` + fixed format
//!      `{domain}-{root}-{max_seq}` means a legitimate retry of the same
//!      event lands inside AWS's 5-minute dedup window with an identical
//!      dedup_id and is silently dropped.
//!
//! Chosen contract (see C-12 in the plan):
//!   * Root-less EventBooks are rejected at the boundary with
//!     `BusError::Publish`. Falling back to a per-event UUID would silently
//!     weaken the documented "ordering by aggregate root" FIFO guarantee.
//!   * dedup_id includes a per-bus-instance monotonic publish counter so
//!     legitimate retries don't collide inside the 5-minute dedup window.
