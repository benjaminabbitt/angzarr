//! Tests for channel-based DLQ publisher.
//!
//! The channel publisher is used for standalone mode and testing. It sends
//! dead letters through an unbounded mpsc channel, requiring manual instantiation
//! to get access to both sender and receiver.
//!
//! Key behaviors verified:
//! - new() returns publisher and receiver pair
//! - Published dead letters are received on the receiver
//! - Multiple dead letters can be queued
//! - Receiver can be dropped without affecting publish (unbounded channel)
